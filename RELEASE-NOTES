Upgrading : 

-- All versions of mirmon use the same state file format, config file format
   and icon set. You can upgrade safely by just replacing program 'mirmon'.

-- It is advisable to update the countries.list :
   http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~penni101/mirmon/svn/trunk/countries.list

----------------------------------------------------------------------
mirmon 2.10 -- 15 augustus 2014

o Probe only one site-url with "mirmon -get url site-url".

----------------------------------------------------------------------
mirmon 2.9 -- 13 augustus 2013

o Added a LICENSE file, requested by fedora packagers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
mirmon 2.8 -- 13 februari 2013

o Fixed the cronjob examples in the doc ; because in crontab(5) entries
  a '%' has to be escaped as "\%".

o Fixed the doc ; html pages are now "XHTML 1.0 Strict" compliant.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
mirmon 2.7 -- Sat Dec 15 09:56:53 CET 2012

o Added option "always_get region ..." for Master, Tier1 etc.

o Changed location of author, svn repository.

--- mirmon 2.6 -- 26 may 2012 ----------------------------------------

o Fixed sorting of 'fake' domain ; ucfirst not is required.

--- mirmon 2.5 -- 24 march 2012 --------------------------------------

o Capitalize region names ; fake domains (like 'Master') should be ucfirst,
  and go to the top of the report list ; 'proper' regions are sorted 'lc'.
  The ISO-country-list is now utf8, Capitalized and complete.

o Faster probe-load averaging by always probing the average number
  of mirrors. The 'ok' and 'not ok' mirrors are averaged separately.

o Show 'project_name' when reporting changes in the mirror-list.

o Show 'path' for rsync urls in the report like 'site::path'.

--- mirmon 2.4 -- 17 january 2011 ------------------------------------

o Fixed a bug (time/res).

--- mirmon 2.3 -- 17 march 2010 --------------------------------------

o Fixed a bug in the countries-list ; added the required '-'.

--- mirmon 2.2 -- 9 march 2010 ---------------------------------------

o Fixed a bug in handling of required/optional config keys.

--- mirmon 2.1 -- 28 jan 2010 ----------------------------------------

o The algorithm to balance the probe load over the hourly mirmon runs
  is improved ; from completely skewed to balanced takes some 5 days.

o Mirmon only reports changes in the mirror_list (inserts and deletes)
  unless in quiet mode ; option -v now shows progress when probing.

o Added some documentation ; fixed some doc bugs.

--- mirmon 2.0 -- 9 jan 2010 ----------------------------------------

o The code was completely reorganized ; hence the bump in the
  major version number.

o The code is now modularised. The distribution contains 'Mirmon.pm',
  an OO interface for mirmon objects. Program 'mirmon' still contains
  all the code ; it is split into 'Mirmon.pm' and 'mirmon.pl'.

o For Mirmon.pm, html and man (source and formatted) pages were added.

o Configuration option 'htm_top' : the supplied text is no longer placed
  between <P> and </P> in the report ; to keep the www validator happy.

o The report is smaller ; html code for the age histogram is improved.

o Formatted man pages (mirmon.txt and mirmon.pm.txt) are now created
  with pod2man and man instead of pod2text.

o Program probe passes options -v and -q to rsync and wget.

o documentation : better guidelines in the 'installation' section.

--- mirmon 1.39 -- 24 dec 2009 --------------------------------------

o The mirror list can now have rsync urls like
    rsync://rsync.apache.org/apache-dist/

o The mirmon distro now contains a sample program 'probe' ;
  a simple Perl program for probing ftp, http and rsync mirrors.

o A new directive 'no-add-slash' prevents mirmon from
  adding a trailing slash to urls, when one is missing.

o The distro now contains a mirmon.1 man page source.

o Internal note : source management changed from rcs to svn.
