# About

Mirmon helps administrators in keeping an eye on the mirror sites. In a
concise graphic format, mirmon shows each site's status history of the
last two weeks. It is easy to spot stale or dead mirrors.

Mirmon has been written by Henk Penning. Since his old homepage at
http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~penni101/
is now unreachable, and I find it a valuable tool, I thought I'd dump
the latest tarballs I had here, so they don't get lost.
